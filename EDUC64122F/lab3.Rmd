### Today's objectives

1. Check your learning in R:

  - describing a categorical variable (present in a table)
  - visualizing a categorical variable (present in a plot)
  - interpret and summarize information from table and plot 
  
2. Learn how to save tables and plots out of RStudio

  - besides the "copy-paste" or "screenshot" strategy (okay to use for assignment 1 but let's get fancy today)

### First thing first

One of the best ways to learn in this class: did you successfully replicate Dr. Liebowitz's code from class OR at least run it on your own computer?

  - Where they are? For class #3, courseweb -> schedule -> unit1 -> lectures -> R code (download it NOW if haven't)
  
  - What you do? Open the script, run the code line-by-line, and see the results for yourself (we'll do this together in a sec)
  
  - What if? Highly likely you will:
     - find it hard to understand all the code - don't dwell on it. You'll revisit it again and again and good news, you'll know more about it each time.
     - run into some issues - best learning opportunity. Solving issues is the way you get better with R.

### Make the lecture code your own (practicing workflow from lab 2)

1. Create a new R project, call it **"class03"**
2. Create four folders, **"data", "code", "table", "plot"**
3. Go to courseweb, download the dataset **"deathpenalty.csv"** (where? courseweb -> schedule -> unit1 -> lectures -> data)
4. Put the dataset in your **data folder**
5. Within your R project, create a new R script (the file with .R extension), call it **"class3_code"**, and save it to your **code folder**
6. DIFFERENT FROM LAB 2, today we'll load a package in the beginning of your R script:
    - library(tidyverse)
7. Write code to load the dataset to your R script, call the dataframe **"df"** (to be consistent with lecture code - IMPORTANT)
8. You are now ready to copy (line #30 forward) from lecture code to your own script

`r countdown(minutes = 6, seconds = 0, left = 0, right = 0, padding = "5px", margin = "2%", font_size = "3em")`
---
### Major learning points from lecture code

1. Recode your categorical variables: run **code line 37-42** in your own R script
2. Present a categorical variable in a table: run **code line 56 and 61** in your own R script
    - alternatively, use package {janitor}: **janitor::tabyl(df, deathpen)**
3. Visualize a categorical variable in a barplot in two ways:
    - Using base R (build-in functions, don't need any package): run **code lines 57 and 62** in your own R script 
    - Using {ggplot2} package (here using code slightly different than the lecture code)
        - myplot <- ggplot(df, aes(rdefend)) + geom_bar(fill = "royalblue", width = 0.6) + xlab("Race of Defendant") + ggtitle("Visualizing rdefend") + geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat='count', vjust = -0.5, size = 4) + ylim(0,1550) + theme_bw()
        - you can do more by manipulating the parameters of each function (e.g., **?geom_bar**) - share with your neighbor what you have discovered!

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 0, left = 0, right = 0, padding = "5px", margin = "2%", font_size = "3em")`
---
### Save your tables out of RStudio
(because most of the time, you need to share your tables and plots without the help of RStudio)

1. Find in the environment (or your previous code) the assigned names of the deathpenalty count table (hint: **counts**) and race proportion table (**prop**)
2. Write the below code to export the tables to .csv files and store them into your **table folder**
    - write.csv(counts, file = "./table/counts.csv", row.names = FALSE)
    - write.csv(prop, file = "./table/prop.csv", row.names = FALSE)
3. Go to your **table folder** and see if they are there

`r countdown(minutes = 6, seconds = 0, left = 0, right = 0, padding = "5px", margin = "2%", font_size = "3em")`

---
### Save your plots out of RStudio

1. Find in the environment (or your previous code) the assigned name of the plot (e.g., **myplot**) 
2. Save all types of plot using export button - which works nice for Base R plots
3. Save the plot created by {ggplot2}: write the below code to export the ggplot to .jpeg file and store it into your **plot folder**
    - ggsave(plot = myplot, "./plot/myplot.jpeg")
4. Go to your **plot folder** and see if it's there
